        <img src="../../../image/planet/mars.jpg" width="200" height="200">
        <p>
       Mars, known as the "Red Planet" for its rusty-colored soil, is the fourth planet from the Sun and is about half the size of Earth. It features a thin atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, a cold, rocky surface, and two small, potato-shaped moons called Phobos and Deimos. Named after the Roman god of war, Mars has been extensively studied, with ongoing research focusing on its potential for past or future habitability. 
Key Characteristics
Size and Position:
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, situated beyond Earth, and is roughly half the size of Earth. 
Color:
The "Red Planet" nickname comes from the iron oxide (rust) in its soil and dust, which gives the planet its distinctive color. 
Atmosphere:
Mars has a very thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of other gases like nitrogen and argon. 
Temperature:
The planet is cold, with temperatures on Mars ranging from very cold in the winter to mild in the summer, and a thin atmosphere unable to trap much heat. 
Moons:
Mars has two small moons named Phobos and Deimos, named after the sons of the Greek god of war, Ares. 
Surface and Features
Rocky and Dry: Mars is a terrestrial, or rocky, planet with a dry, dusty surface. 
Polar Ice Caps: The planet has water ice and frozen carbon dioxide at its north and south poles. 
Large Geological Features: The Martian landscape features impact craters and a vast canyon system called Valles Marineris, which is longer than the distance across the United States. 
Exploration and Habitability
Ancient and Modern Observation:
Mars has been observed by ancient astronomers and is now one of the most explored bodies in the solar system. 
Potential for Life:
While currently lifeless, scientists are exploring the possibility that life could have existed or may still exist on Mars, particularly in its subsurface. 
Challenges for Life:
The planet's harsh surface conditions, due to its thin atmosphere and lack of liquid water, make it difficult for life as we know it to thrive on the surface.

    <div class="card-2"><h1>Sun Family</h1>

     <p>
        The "sun family," more commonly known as the Solar System, is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It is an appropriate metaphor because the Sun's immense gravity acts like a parent, 
        holding all the celestial bodies in its orbit.The vast collection of celestial bodies that make up the Solar System include: 
The Sun: The star at the center of the system, a hot ball of hydrogen and helium, which provides the light and energy for the entire family.
Eight planets: Large, spherical bodies that orbit the Sun.
Inner, terrestrial planets: Small, dense, and rocky planets closer to the Sun.
Mercury: The smallest planet, closest to the Sun.
Venus: The hottest planet due to a thick, toxic atmosphere.
Earth: The only planet known to support life.
Mars: Known as the "Red Planet," with volcanoes and ancient riverbeds.
Outer, gas and ice giants: Much larger planets made primarily of gases or ices.
Jupiter: The largest planet in the Solar System, famous for its Great Red Spot.
Saturn: Known for its distinct and magnificent rings.
Uranus: Notable for its sideways rotation.
Neptune: The most distant planet, known for its strong winds.
Dwarf planets: Bodies that are large enough to be rounded by their own gravity but have not "cleared the neighborhood" around their orbits. Officially recognized dwarf planets include Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
Moons: Natural satellites that orbit planets or other bodies. Mercury and Venus have none, while others have many, with Jupiter and Saturn having the most.
Asteroids: Millions of irregularly shaped rocky and metallic objects that primarily reside in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Comets and meteoroids: Small bodies of ice and rock that travel through the system, leaving tails of gas and dust when they pass near the Sun.
Kuiper Belt: A ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit that includes many dwarf planets and comets.

        Currently, no human has been to Mars, but several national space agencies and private companies are preparing for crewed missions in the coming decades. Living on Mars presents extreme challenges,
         requiring significant technological innovation to create a safe, sustainable environment.
